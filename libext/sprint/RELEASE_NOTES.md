Release Notes
==================
Phabricator Sprint Extension release/2015-04-22
2015-04-22

####Description
- The burndown chart now gets its data from the board.  The board columns define the sprint task status.
These are currently statically typed with the names "Backlog", "Doing", "Review" and "Done".
Additional columns can be added, but they are not reflected in the Charts.

- Rather than using the special character to designate a Sprint project, the new method is to simply check the
"Is Sprint" box in the project create/edit form.

- Moving a task into the done column then adds points to "points closed today" on the chart.
This can be "undone", which then changes the points remaining back to where they were before the task was "closed".
The indication of "points closed today" however can not be changed retroactively.

- If a task is added during the Sprint, the "ceiling" of total points for the entire Sprint is increased.
This then always yields a new ideal points line and an accurate points remaining.

- If a task is moved to Done before the Sprint start and still in the Sprint, points remaining will be off by the
points for that task.  Suggestion is to either extend the Sprint Start date to before the task was closed or remove
the closed task from the Sprint.

- Long sprints are now possible to chart, as x-axis tick culling removes extra labels.

- Blocker and Blocked flags are shown in the task table.  However, if a task is blocked by a task that is not in
the Sprint, the flag will not show.  Suggestion is to always included blockers as part of the Sprint, even if they are
not necessarily planning to be worked on.  As long as a task has at least one open blocker, it is considered Blocked.
Hovering over a Blocker flag shows a tool-tip that indicates the Blocked tasks.

- Restriction of Task Card movement on the Sprint board is possible using the Edit policy for the Sprint project.

- The Sprint Board shows all tasks by default.  This differs from the Work Board which filters resolved tasks by default.

- Board Columns can designate a "Point Limit".  If this is exceeded, the column header turns red.

- the task table, the events table and the Sprint Burndown List table are now equipped with pagination, search
filtering and column ordering.

- Exporting of table data to CSV is enabled.

- the default Maniphest Burn Up report has been improved for Sprint.  It can be accessed from the Sprint
application page side bar.
